Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment: CodeBook
====
##What this script does:
*Sources data from:
     "test\subject_test.txt"
     "test\X_test.txt"
     "test\y_test.txt"
     "train\subject_train.txt"
     "train\X_train.txt"
     "train\y_train.txt"

*Merges data sets into a single data set

*Extracts the mean and standard deviations

*Sets meaningful names and labels to the data set

*Merges and exports a tidy dataset with the mean and standard deviations

*Merges and exports a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 

##Variables
*Variables included in the data set are the mean and standard deviation for:
     "tBodyAcc-XYZ"
     "tGravityAcc-XYZ"
     "tBodyAccJerk-XYZ"
     "tBodyGyro-XYZ"
     "tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ"
     "tBodyAccMag"
     "tGravityAccMag"
     "tBodyAccJerkMag"
     "tBodyGyroMag"
     "tBodyGyroJerkMag"
     "fBodyAcc-XYZ"
     "fBodyAccJerk-XYZ"
     "fBodyGyro-XYZ"
     "fBodyAccMag"
     "fBodyAccJerkMag"
     "fBodyGyroMag"
     "fBodyGyroJerkMag"
     
In addition, the "Activity" and "Subjects" are included
